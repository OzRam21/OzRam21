### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a chemist/chemical engineer that is striving to make the transition into IT and cyber security. I want to make a positive personal impact on people through technology.
I orginaly decided follow a career in chemistry/chemical engineering because I love having the ability to create useful things for others and explore new frontiers in science. 
Now my love for science has evolved into a passion for technology and using it to support others, and play a role in keeping people safe in today's chaotic digital age.

I'm currently learning the following through practice: Python, Powershell, and Ansible.

I'm looking for help with learning: Pentesting tools, DFIR, DevSecOps, API, Web Hacking, Terraform, and advanced Linux skills.

I'm currently using the following to learn and improve my skills: TryHackMe, No Starch Press Books, Udemy courses, and Youtube.

Current goal and focus(s):
  - Pass the CCNA 200-301 EXAM: Currently studying and practing with labs on Cisco Packet Tracer.
  - Keep practicing Python skills: Will soon post practice programs I have authored as I work through the 'Automating the Boring stuff with Python' by Al Sweigart.

Short Term Goals:
  - Publish Python and PowerShell scripts that I author as I learn from Udemy classes and books.
  - Attain Cloud certifications: Google Cloud, AWS, or MS Azure
  - Share projects that I have carried out in my home lab
  - Author guides for starting your own lab and helpful resources to others looking to start in the cyber security field

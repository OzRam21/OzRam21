### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a chemist/chemical engineer that is striving to make the transition into IT and cyber security. I want to make a positive personal impact on people through technology. 

I'm currently learning the following through practice: Python, Powershell, and Ansible.

I'm looking for help with learning: Pentesting tools, DFIR, DevSecOps, API, Web Hacking, Terraform, and advanced Linux skills.

I'm currently using the following to learn and improve my skills: TryHackMe, No Starch Press Books, Udemy courses, and Youtube.

Short Term Goals:
  - Publish Python and PowerShell scripts that I author as I learn from Udemy classes and books.
  - Attain Cloud certifications: Google Cloud, AWS, or MS Azure
  - Share projects that I have carried out in my home lab
  - Author guides for starting your own lab and helpful resources to others looking to start in the cyber security field
